## PETstock Front End Developer Assessment
The goal of assessment is to test you skills JavaScript and SCSS using the VueJS framework. 

We've created a collection of product data for you to work with which can be found in `src/data.json`.

Work should be completed in the `src/App.vue` file. 

The application should display a list of product information and allow the User to filter and sort the results.
